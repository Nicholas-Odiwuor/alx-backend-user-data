# 0x01. Basic Authentication

## üìö Background Context

Authentication is a key step in securing APIs and applications. In this project, we build a custom **Basic Authentication** system in Python to understand how authentication works under the hood.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: In production systems, always use established libraries or frameworks like `Flask-HTTPAuth` for security and reliability. This project is intended for educational purposes only.
