# 0x02. Session Authentication

## 📚 Background
In this project, you will implement a **Session Authentication** system from scratch — without using any external modules. This hands-on approach is for learning purposes. In real-world applications, built-in or third-party solutions (e.g., Flask-HTTPAuth) should be used.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What authentication and session authentication are
- What cookies are and how they work
- How to send and parse cookies

## 🔗 Resources
- REST API Authentication Mechanisms (Session auth section)
- HTTP Cookies
- Flask & Flask Cookies

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Python 3.7** on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- All files must be executable and end with a new line
- Code must follow **pycodestyle** (v2.5)
- Each file, module, class, and function must have meaningful documentation
- The first line of each file: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Project must include this `README.md`

## 🗂️ Project Structure
This project includes:
- Custom session authentication logic
- Manual cookie handling
- Full backend integration without external auth modules
